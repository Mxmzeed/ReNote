Every good notetaking app has to have a name that is not only easy to remember but fits the theme. In our case ReNote NSTC (Name Subject To Change) is an app designed mainly for me. 

Like most people, when I have an idea for a project, it doesn't all come at the same time. It comes in bits and pieces I end up either forgetting, scribbling down then never looking at again, or talking to it to ChatGPT to then forget about it to then remember about it a few weeks later.

I realized <b>THAT</b> was the biggest thing holding me back, simply being disorganized. So why not build something to organize for me.

That's where ReNote NSTC comes in. The biggest thing I wanted was a way to easily write down something and have other systems classify it in the right place for me.
